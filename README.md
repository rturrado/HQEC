# HQEC

This is the first "lite" version of HQEC operator push package, contains an example of heptagon Steane Code.

I would  add a few sections here:

Build guide:
- If needed, how to checkout your project, how to build it, and so on. E.g.:

```
$> git clone blahblahblah
```

User guide:
- If I download this project, what can I run, and how. E.g.:

```
HQEC $> python operator push foo blah
```
